# Boids

Boids is a simulation of flocking behavior in animals such as birds, fish, or insects. It is based on a simple set of rules that govern the movement of individuals in a group, resulting in emergent collective behavior. This simulation models how local interactions can lead to complex group dynamics, commonly used in studies of artificial life, robotics, and computer graphics.

## Running the Simulation

To start the simulation, run:

```bash
python boids.py  
```
